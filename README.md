# Advanced Benford
Over the summer of 2021, I worked as a research analyst for Professor Sybil Prince-Nelson in the Washington and Lee Mathematics department. We analyzed the distributions of note and frequencies of thousands of songs ranging from the classical genre to modern pop. I developed this R package to support future researchers in the computational music field. This repository contains a R package with useful function for the Benford analysis of music.

Our results titled "Benfordâ€™s Law and Music Note Frequencies" were published in the Journal of Mathematics and Computation in Music and presented at the
International Conference on Mathematics and Computation in Music. Here is a [link to the paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-07015-0_34).
